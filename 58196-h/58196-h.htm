<h2 class="mt3">LIGHTING SYSTEM OF THE ORCUTT OIL FIELDS.</h2>

<p class="center bold">By CLEM A. COPELAND.</p>

<p class="center">Consulting Engineer, Los Angeles, Cal.</p>

<p>The large and deep-lying oil-sand lakes and subterranean
gas works, commencing with the southern rim of
the Santa Maria Valley and stretching away for a dozen
miles southward toward Santa Barbara, contribute some
14,600,000 barrels of high gravity refining and fuel oil to
California’s annual production of 40,000,000 barrels.</p>

<p class="caption">WEST FRAME OF 2600 FT. SPAN. POWER-HOUSE IN BACKGROUND.</p>
</div>

<p>With the assistance of two eight-inch pipe lines 32 miles
to Port Harford, a similar line 48 miles across the Isthmus
of Panama, and a goodly fleet of vessels, the Union Oil
Company scatters this oil from Seattle to San Diego, and
from New York to Japan. Chile also has a share for the
working of its nitre beds and its railways.</p>

<p>The little towns of Santa Maria and Orcutt receive with
open pipes a tithe of the gas which nature has here stored,
and which would otherwise escape the many safety valves,
while the steam rig engines have often been run with direct
gas pressure from the wells.</p>

<p>This land of gas and gushers is difficult of control, and is
always ready to pop off at from 100 to 400 pounds pressure
through the many 3,000-foot tubes which puncture its depths.
When a new gusher is brought in, it sprays the adjacent
hills with a glistening shadow of petroleum and is no respecter
of persons or property. One new and frisky fury
flowed 12,000 barrels per day, and delivered 4,000,000 cubic
feet of gas every 24 hours for four months, gradually dropping
to a production of 7,000 barrels, which it maintained
for nearly a year, finally diminishing to 3,500, and now, after
three and a third years, is still producing 250 barrels per day,
having delivered during this time 3,000,000 barrels of petroleum,
and enough gas to last San Francisco for three years.
This is, with perhaps one exception, the most remarkable
well in the history of oil industry, and is widely known as
“Hartwell No. 1.”</p>

<p>The district contains two groups of wells, one contiguous
to Orcutt, and the other near Lompoc. Danger from
fire due to the excessive gas pressure of the Orcutt fields is
exceedingly great, as evidenced by the burning of four “rigs”
in the first two years of its history, during which time there
were fifteen wells brought into production. The cost of these
“rigs” exceeded the cost of the lighting plant, which is described
in these notes, and no fires have since occurred in
the sixty wells now producing. The advisability of the plant
is therefore quite patent.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>The lighting system employed in the Orcutt oil fields
is perhaps only interesting in illustrating how the methods
employed in large undertakings may be used to great advantage
in the smaller enterprises to effect a large saving
and to simplify conventional methods. The smaller undertakings
often afford opportunities of saving a larger percentage
in cost and operation in connection with the larger
ones. In the present instance, an economy of $9,000 was
made in a system which would have cost $30,000 if constructed
along conventional lines.</p>

<p>As may be seen from some of the views in these notes,
the country covered by the system is very hilly and stony,
hard sandstone being everywhere prominent. Trees would
have interfered considerably over perhaps a third of the line
with ordinary construction, and being oak, it would have
cost heavily to eliminate them. Although the winters in
this section are very bleak and windy, no snow has ever
fallen. The attached map shows the wells, which are unusually
far apart and scattered over some 5,000 acres of land.</p>

<p class="caption">FRAME BETWEEN 1500 AND 1600 FT. SPAN.</p>
</div>

<p>Long span work, employing copper cables, and using
the oil-well derricks for support, seemed well to meet these
and all other conditions in the most economical fashion.
The adoption of long span work effected a large saving in
the length of line and wire needed to cover the territory,
since air-line routes could be covered in all cases across
country, without any care being taken to lay out a pole line
which would conform to some general inflexible plan.
Moreover, much vertical distance was saved in not having
to follow the contour of the country. Incidentally the long
span work makes the installation of new pieces of line very
easy and simple, and no large amount of material need be
kept on hand for expansion purposes.</p>

<p>Where conditions are rapidly changing, as in the present
instance, existing lines having to be moved because of the
abandonment of wells or re-arrangement as new wells come
in amongst the old ones, are easily changed, with but little
loss of labor and material. The derricks, 80 feet in height,
make ideal supports for long-span construction, and steel
frames, heavy enough for the largest size of wire, eventually
were made of “scrap” pipe set in cement. Where the derricks
were not available, redwood “dead-men” were also used
between derricks which were near together, but on opposite
sides of rises or hills. The present system of distribution is
72,550 feet, or 13.75 miles, in length, and consists of 70 derricks,
9 frames, and 10 “dead-men,” making the average span
about 800 feet. The seven-strand bare copper cables used
in this work were furnished under rigid specifications previously
described in the “Journal,” by the Standard Underground
Cable Company. One will observe from the map
and photos that there are many spans 1,500 feet in length,
one span of 2,000 feet between derricks and one 2,600 feet
from one frame to another. The sags allowed correspond
to 60 feet on a 2,000-foot span, and the cables were very
small for such work, No. 6 being used for the greatest lengths,
which occurs as a neutral on the longest spans. The sizes
used are Nos. 2, 4, and 6.</p>

<p>As the cables were suspended high above the ground and
good construction was relied upon for safety from breakage,
they were used without insulation, and a large saving was
thus effected. “Goose-egg” strain insulators, first designed
by the writer several years ago, are used to insulate the
cables. Copper sleeves were used to splice the cables and to
loop them to the insulators.</p>

<p>It is of considerable interest to observe the action of
these light cables in a high wind, for even in the most gusty
storms there is no whipping action. In the longer spans, the
cables hang absolutely parallel and sway in a most deliberate
manner from 12 to 25 feet out of line.</p>

<p class="caption">DETAIL OF DERRICK CONSTRUCTION.</p>
</div>

<p>Inasmuch as fuel economy is of little importance, since
either waste gas or oil can be used, a large drop in the distributing
system is permissible, and a radius of three or four
miles from the power-house can be economically attained by
the use of 210 to 250 volt lamps on the three-wire direct-current
system. At present the maximum distance is 255
miles, and four voltages of lamps are employed. The derricks
are wired on the two-wire system with No. 14 T. B.
W. P. medium, hard-drawn wire, care being taken to keep
all wires on the outside of derrick house wherever possible.
Although the wires and insulators have been in some cases
completely sprayed and saturated with oil from the gushers,
no troubles of insulation have been experienced.</p>

<p>At the time this work was started, there was a small
plant on the Pinal Oil Company’s property near by, where
keyed sockets were used until one of the drillers was injured
by a gas explosion caused by turning off one of the
lights. This, of course, suggested the care necessary to
guard against such accidents. In the present installation,
double-pole fuses were constructed for each derrick and tank
house, by using two weatherproof sockets and Edison plug
fuses, all inclosed in a gauze cylinder like a Davy mine lamp.
Switches for tank house and derricks were also inclosed in
gauze. In wiring the derricks, sleeves were used for splicing,
so that in the whole system no solder nor torch was used.
Specially designed heavy wire lamp guards and portables,
with wires inclosed in cotton-covered garden hose, are other
features of the derrick wiring. When drilling is commenced,
the derrick is wired for eleven lights. Tank houses, some
fifteen or twenty in number, are wired with a light over each
tank.</p>

<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="400" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption">POWER-HOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p>The power-house is of only passing interest, being designed
for reliability and minimum first cost, and with the
idea of transplanting it to some new location should future
conditions dictate. The view shows two 10×10 Shepherd
engines, clutched to either end of a shaft, from which two
45-kilowatt, 250-volt, direct-current Westinghouse generators
are belted. In case of accident to one generator, a switch
on the switchboard converts the 3-wire to a 2-wire system,
using the two outside wires as one, and the neutral as the
return conductor. Three 48×14 fire-tube boilers supply steam
at 125 pounds pressure. The power-house is in a perennially
cool location on a hill crest, so that it could be made small
and cozy.</p>

<p>The system has been in uninterrupted and satisfactory
operation for two years. The only trouble during the time
was caused by one wire of one span breaking, due to an
imperfection in splicing. The section has long-continued and
severe winds, much rain and cold weather, but two winters
have developed no imperfections. Although the lights burn
all night, no interruption has been experienced. Reliability
is important, since, if the lights failed, there would be a
temptation to light candles or lanterns at a critical time.</p>

<p>The system was designed and supervised by Mr. Copeland,
of Messrs. Clem. Copeland and F. R. Schanck, consulting
engineers for the Union Oil Company. Mr. C. W. Crawley,
who is at present electrical superintendent, was foreman
of construction.</p>

<h2>ALCOHOL vs. GASOLINE FOR POWER.</h2>

<p>The Technologic Branch of the United States Geological
Survey, under the direction of Mr. J. A. Holmes, has recently
completed an elaborate series of tests on the relative
value of gasoline and alcohol as producers of power. The
tests, over two thousand in number, probably represent the
most complete and exact investigation of the kind that has
been made, either in this country or abroad, and includes
much original research work.</p>

<p>Correspondingly well-designed alcohol and gasoline engines
when running under the most advantageous conditions
for each, will consume equal volumes of the fuel for
which they are designed. This statement is based on the
results of many tests made under the most favorable practical
conditions that could be obtained for the size and type
of engines and fuel used. An average of the minimum fuel
consumption values thus obtained, gives a like figure of
eight-tenths (.8) of a pint per hour per brake horsepower for
gasoline and alcohol.</p>

<p>Considering that the heat value of a gallon of the denatured
alcohol is only a little over six-tenths (.6) that of a
gallon of the gasoline, this result of equal fuel consumption
by volume for gasoline and alcohol engines probably represents
the best comparative value that can be obtained for
alcohol at the present time, as is also indicated by continental
practice. Though the possibility of obtaining this
condition in practice here has been thoroughly demonstrated
at the Government Fuel-testing Plant, it yet remains with
the engine manufacturers to make the “equal fuel consumption
by volume” a commercial basis of comparison.</p>

<p>The gasoline engines that were used in these tests are
representative of the standard American stationary-engine
types, rating at 10 to 15 horsepower, at speeds of from 250
to 300 revolutions per minute, while the alcohol engines were
of similar construction and identical in size with the gasoline
engines.</p>

<p>The air was not preheated for the above tests on alcohol
and gasoline, and the engines were equipped with the ordinary
types of constant level suction lift and constant level
pressure spray carburetters. Many special tests with air preheated
to various temperatures up to 250° Fahrenheit, and
tests with special carburetters were made, but no beneficial
effects traceable to better carburation were found when the
engines were handled under the special test conditions, including
constant speed and best load.</p>

<p>The commercial completely denatured alcohol referred to
is 100 parts ethyl alcohol plus 10 parts methyl alcohol plus
one-half of one part benzol, and corresponds very closely to 94
per cent by volume or 91 per cent by weight ethyl alcohol
(grain alcohol).</p>

<p>No detrimental effects on the cylinder walls and valves of
the engines were found from the use of the above denatured
alcohol.</p>

<p>The lowest consumption values were obtained with the
highest compression that it was found practical to use; which
compression for the denatured alcohol ranged from 150 to 180
pounds per square inch above atmosphere.</p>

<p>Eighty per cent alcohol (alcohol and water) for use in
engines of the present types would have to sell for at least
15 per cent less per gallon than the denatured alcohol, in
order to compete with it. The minimum consumption values
in gallons per hour per brake horsepower for 80 per cent
alcohol is approximately 17.5 per cent greater than for the
denatured alcohol used, or for gasoline. A series of tests
made with alcohol of various percentages by volume ranging
from 94 per cent to 50 per cent, showed that the minimum
consumption values in gallons per hour per brake horsepower
increased a little more rapidly than the alcohol decreased in
percentage of pure alcohol. That is, the thermal efficiency
decreased with the decrease in percentage of pure alcohol.
This decrease in thermal efficiency or increase in consumption
referred to pure alcohol is, however, comparatively slight
from 100 per cent alcohol down to about 80 per cent alcohol.
Within these limits it may be neglected in making the calculations
necessary to compare the minimum consumption
values for tests with different percentages of alcohol.</p>

<p>The nearer the alcohol is to pure, the greater the maximum
horsepower of the engine. The per cent reduction in
maximum horsepower for 80 per cent alcohol as compared
with that for denatured alcohol used, was less than one per
cent, but the starting and regulating difficulties are appreciably
increased.</p>

<p>With suitable compression, mixtures of gasoline and alcohol
vapors (double carburetters) gave thermal efficiencies
ranging between that for gasoline (maximum 22.2 per cent)
and that for alcohol (maximum 34.6 per cent) but in no case
were they higher than that for alcohol. The above thermal
efficiencies are calculated from the brake horsepower and the
low calorific value of the fuel, which for the gasoline was
19,100 British thermal units per pound, and for the denatured
alcohol was 10,500 British thermal units per pound.</p>

<p>As has been previously published, alcohol can be used
with more or less satisfaction in stationary and marine gasoline
engines and these gasoline engines will use from one and
one-half to twice as much alcohol as gasoline when operating
under the same conditions. The possibilities, however, of
altering the ordinary gasoline engines as required to obtain
the best economies with alcohol are very limited; for the
amount that the compression can be raised without entirely
redesigning the cylinder head and valve arrangement is ordinarily
not sufficient, nor are the gasoline engines usually built
heavy enough to stand the maximum explosive pressures,
which often reach six and seven hundred pounds per square
inch. With the increase in weight for the same-sized engine
designed to use alcohol instead of gasoline, comes an increase
in maximum horsepower of a little over thirty-five per cent
(35%), so that its weight per horsepower need not be greater
than that of the gasoline engine, and probably will be less.</p>

<p>The work was taken up to investigate the characteristic
action of fuels used in internal combustion engines with a
detailed study of the action of each fuel (gasoline and alcohol)
as governed by the many variable conditions of engine
manipulation, design and equipment. These variables were
isolated, so far as possible; their separate and combined effects
were determined; worked out under practical operating
conditions; and led up to the conditions required for minimum
fuel consumption. The results show the saving that
can be obtained over conditions for maximum consumption,
and also establish a definite basis of comparison under conditions
most favorable to each fuel. This latter is a point of
much commercial interest, and a study of the comparative
action of gasoline and alcohol may be of great service in
solving some of the general internal-combustion-engine problems
where other than liquid fuels are used.</p>

<p>A large number of fundamental tests were necessary in
order to clearly define conditions and interpret results. In a
way they follow the work conducted by the Department of
Agriculture, supplementing to a certain extent, but not duplicating
bulletin 191, which gives much data of general value.</p>

<p>Many of the tests of internal-combustion engines have
been made, but most of them, especially in this country, were
by private concerns, for a specified purpose, and the results
are not generally available. Furthermore, as is generally recognized
by those familiar with gas, and especially gasoline-engine
operation, the conditions influencing engine performance
are so numerous and varied as to make the value of offhand
comparison very limited and oftentimes misleading, exact
comparisons only being possible under identical conditions
or with reference to the actual known differences in
all conditions that influence the results.</p>

<h2>ELECTRICAL CODE REVISIONS.</h2>

<p>At the recent meeting of the Underwriters’ National Electric
Association it was decided that Cooper Hewitt lamps must
have a cut-out for each lamp or series, except when contained
in a single frame and lighted by a single operation, in which
case not more than five lamps shall be dependent on a single
cut-out. The regulators must be enclosed in non-combustible
cases, and where subject to flyings of lint or combustible material,
all openings through the casings must be protected by a
fine wire gauze. Moore electric light tubes must be installed
so as to be free from liability to mechanical injury or of contact
with inflammable material. The high-potential coils and
regulating apparatus must be installed in an approved steel cabinet,
which shall be ventilated in such a manner as to prevent
the escape of flame or sparks in case of burn-out. The apparatus
in this box must be mounted on slate, and the enclosing
case positively grounded. The supply conductors must comply
with the rules governing low-potential systems where such wires
do not carry current having a potential of over 300 volts.</p>

<p>Rule 8, section <i>d</i>, was amended to apply to auto-starters
only, and a new section was added to rule 60 governing the
details of rheostat construction. New rules regarding low-potential
transformers follow: Oil transformers must not be
placed inside of any building except central stations and sub-stations,
unless by special permission of the inspection department.
Air-cooled transformers must not be placed inside of
any building excepting central stations and sub-stations, unless
the highest voltage of either primary or secondary does not
exceed 550 volts, and must be so mounted that the case shall
be one foot from combustible material or separated therefrom
by non-combustible, non-absorptive, insulating material, such as
slate or marble. Where transformers are placed at a lesser
distance, a slab of slate or marble somewhat larger than the
transformer must be used, and where the transformer is
mounted on a side wall, the slate or marble must be secured
independent of the transformer supports, the transformer being
supported by bolts countersunk at least one-eighth inch below
the surface of the back of the slab and filled.</p>

<p>For wiring electric cranes the following rules were adopted:
All wires except bare collector wires, those between resistances
and contact plates of rheostats and those subjected to severe
external heat, must be approved, rubber-covered and not smaller
in size than No. 12 B. &amp; S. Wires between resistances and
contact plates of rheostats must conform to No. 4-c, unless the
wires are exposed to moisture, in which case the insulation
must also be rubber. Wires subjected to severe external heat
must have approved slow-burning insulation. All wires, excepting
collector wires and those run in metal conduit or armored
cable, must be supported by knobs or cleats which separate them
at least one inch from the surface wired over, but in dry places
where space is limited and the distance between wires as required
by Rule 24-h cannot be obtained, each wire must be
separately encased in approved flexible tubing securely fastened
in place. Collector wires must be supported by approved insulators
so mounted that even with the extreme movement permitted
the wires will be separated at all times at least one and
one-half inches from the surface wired over. Collector wires
must be held at the ends by approved strain insulators.</p>

<p>Where the wires are arranged in a horizontal plane above
the crane, they must be supported at least every twenty feet if
practicable, and separated at least six inches, but if longer
spans are necessary, the distance between wires must be increased
proportionately, the span in no case to exceed forty
feet. If not arranged in a horizontal plane, they must be carried
along the runways and must be rigidly and securely
attached to their insulating supports at least every twenty feet,
and if not arranged in a vertical plane, must be separated at
least eight inches.</p>

<p>Where bridge collector wires are over eighty feet long,
insulating supports on which the wires may loosely lie must be
provided at least every fifty feet. Bridge collector wires must
be kept at least two and one-half inches apart, but a greater
spacing should be used whenever it may be obtained. Collector
wires must not be smaller in size than specified in the following
table for the various spans:</p>

<table summary="Sizing of wires">
  <tr>
    <th>Distance between<br />rigid supports.<br />Feet.</th>
    <th>Size wire<br />required.<br />B. &amp; S.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0 to 30</td>
    <td>6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>31 to 60</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Over 60</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Collectors must be so designed that sparking will be reduced
to a minimum between them and collector wires. The main
collector wires must be protected by a cut-out and the circuit
controlled by a switch, cut-out and switch to be so located as
to be easy of access from the floor. Cranes operated from
cabs must have a cut-out and switch connected into the leads
from the main collector wires and so located in the cab as to
be readily accessible to the operator. Where there is more than
one motor on a single crane, each motor lead must be protected
by a cut-out located in the cab if there is one.</p>

<p>Controllers must be installed according to No. 4, except
that if the crane is located outdoors the wires between resistances
and contact plates of rheostats may be rubber-covered or
bare or slow-burning if properly supported. If the crane operates
over readily combustible material, the resistances must be
placed in a fire-resisting enclosure; or, if located in a cab, the
cab must be constructed of non-combustible material and sides
provided which enclose the cab from its floor to a height at
least six inches above the top of the resistance.</p>

<p>The motor frames, the entire frame of the crane and the
tracks must be permanently and effectively grounded.</p>

<p>A number of recommendations were made calling for conductive
coatings on cables, outlet boxes and fittings in order to
secure better electrical contact at all points throughout systems
in which they are used.</p>

<p>The following suggested changes in the rules were adopted:
The fine print note under rule 2, section a, was amended to
read as follows: “Wires from generator to switchboard may,
however, be placed in conduit, provided that proper precautions
are taken to protect them against moisture and mechanical injury.
If lead-covered cable is used no further protection against
moisture will be required, etc.” Section c of the same rule
was amended by inserting the words, “where not in conduit,”
after the first word. The last sentence of the fine print note
in rule 12, section g, was amended to read: “The outer or
weather end of conduit is to be provided with approved devices
having wires separated and bushed through porcelain.”</p>

<p>A number of changes were made in rule 24. Section a,
with fine-print note, was stricken from the Code; section o was
amended by making the first recommendation “a turn of 90 deg.,
etc.”; section p was amended so as to restrict the number of
different circuits in the same conduit to four two-wire or three
three-wire; section x was changed by substituting the word <i>or</i>
after the word <i>fastenings</i> for <i>of</i>. Rule 24A was also changed
somewhat. Section d was amended so as not to prohibit the
installation of armored cable without the lead covering in buildings
of fireproof construction in locations free from moisture;
the word “underground” was omitted from the first line of the
fine-print note under section a. A new section was added as
follows: “All bends must be so made that the armor of the
cable will not be injured. The radius of the curve of the inner
edge of any bend not to be less than one and one-half inches.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Rule 28, section e, was amended so as to exclude flexible
cord from show cases as well as show windows; the fine-print
note under section g was omitted. A number of minor changes
were made in the rules governing the wiring of theaters, principally
in inserting the words, “or armored cable,” so as to
permit the use of the latter as an alternative to rigid conduit.
The other changes have to do with the details of construction,
fitting, etc. Among the miscellaneous suggestions adopted were
the following: All self-fastening knobs, cleats and supports
must be secured by suitable screws; wires in molding must be
in continuous lengths from outlet to outlet or from fitting to
fitting; sockets or rosettes cannot be used to dead-end a circuit;
soap-stone can be used as an alternative for slate or marble;
and ends of flexible wire need not be soldered before insertion
under binding posts, as called for in rule 14, section c.</p>

<h2>EDITORIAL.</h2>

<div class="sidenote">MANUFACTURING
OPPORTUNITY.</div>

<p>The first half century of Western development
was accomplished without the aid of cheap fuel. This
lack was really a blessing in disguise,
for it applied the needed spur
that finally forced the utilization of
its protean water powers. But with
the development of its latent oil resources there became
available a fuel whose cheapness and convenience
should enable the West to compete in the manufacturing
field.</p>

<p>There has been no factor of greater use and with
less recognition, in this attainment, than the aid given
by the engineer. The first and most pressing problem
was the taming of the furious force of newly tapped
gushers, so as to regulate and control their flow with
reference to reservoir capacity. But so irresistible
were some that they could no more be restrained than
can the waves of the ocean. Millions of barrels flowed
to wanton waste. Earthen barricades were hastily
built around open pools, and considerable oil was thus
preserved, only to be flooded into an unready market,
whose demand was not sufficient to absorb the sudden
oil supply. Nor were the existing means of transportation
suitable.</p>

<p>Here, indeed, was work to be done. How quickly
a market was created is indicated by the fact that in
1906 the local consumption was greater than the
production. This was due to an accumulation
caused by low prices, the average being less than
twenty-five cents, and the minimum ten cents. A fleet
of tank steamers and a pipe line across the Isthmus of
Panama soon gave access to the Atlantic, and Pacific
possibilities were vigorously developed, so that the
demand has already doubled this price.</p>

<p>With regard to the crude oil, boilers and furnaces
have been reconstructed so as to efficiently use the
new fuel. Radical changes were necessary in order
to provide increased air capacity and new means of
air distribution. The very best of our engineering
talent have been so successfully concerned with this
problem that fuel oil is now used in nearly every steam
plant on land and sea, for both stationary and locomotive
use. Petroleum-enriched water gas is much
superior in cost and quality to the illuminant it is displacing,
and now requires considerable oil. Smelting
with oil will soon be an accomplished fact in spite of
many difficulties, and oil engines such as the Diesel
also utilize the crude.</p>

<p>Following its utilization as fuel, there came its
varied applications as a refined product. Gasoline and
engine oils were separated for use in the various types
of explosive engines, lubricating oils were distilled to
make the running easier, and from the residue, asphalt
was taken to meet the good roads movement. Many
other varied uses have been developed for this product,
including its application to roofing and weatherproofing.
Chemists have found that most of the California
oil, as well as that from the Texas fields, contains an
asphaltum rather than a paraffine base, which thus distinguishes
them from most of the Eastern oils.</p>

<p>Coincident with this increasing use of oil during
the past decade have been the improvements in the
method of carrying it. The great expense of reaching
this engineer-made market demanded that cheap transportation
be provided. Long pipe lines have been
built, which pour the oil directly into the refinery or
into ships that take it to a foreign market. One nearly
three hundred miles long was constructed, but proved
inoperative on account of the great viscosity of the oil.
But even this difficulty has been met and overcome by
an entirely new principle that promises to solve the
problem, and forms one of the interesting stories the
“Journal” has yet to tell.</p>

<p>Not less important than the engineering problems
already outlined is that detailed in this issue by our
friend, Mr. Clem. A. Copeland. Disastrous fires have
consumed millions of gallons, and any means that
lessens this needless waste is welcomed. Incidentally
it illustrates the importance of studying other jobs in
relation to their possible application to new problems.
The adoption of long-span work required courage,
which has been justified by the results. It is not our
province to discuss the ethics of competitive struggles
which have characterized the history of oil wherever
developed in large quantities in this country. But, as
long as competition endures, stagnation is prevented,
and it is undoubtedly due to this stress that so much
engineering ingenuity has resulted.</p>

<h2>TRADE CATALOGUES.</h2>

<p>Holophane Reflectors for Gem, Meridian, Tantalum and
Tungsten lamps are illustrated and described in Bulletin No. 6
from the Holophane Company of New York City.</p>

<p>Bulletin No. 21 from H. Krantz Mfg. Co., 160-166 Seventh St.,
Brooklyn, N. Y., illustrates and describes Standard and Water-Tight
Boxes for all electrical installation purposes. This line
includes floor, wall, ceiling, elevator, receptacle, switch, conduit
and junction boxes, as well as boxes with plugs and receptacles
for either wood, concrete or parquet floors or marine installations.</p>

<p>The General Electric Company, Schenectady, N. Y., in
Bulletin No. 4,576, describes the Type F, Form K-3 line of oil
switches for panel installation and remote control, on systems of
4,500 volts or less. The object of Bulletin No. 4,578 is to describe
the essentials of the various standard controllers that are
manufactured for railway service, with special reference to the
operating conditions for which each type is suited. Among the
controllers described are Type B, which include the necessary
contacts and connections for electric braking, Type K for series
parallel operation of the motors, Type L, also in the series parallel
class, but which completely open the power circuit when
changing from series to parallel; Type R, which are designed to
control the motor speeds by means of resistance only, and a
brief outline of the Sprague-General Electric Type M control
system. The General Electric CQ motor is described in detail
in a 16-page bulletin. This motor is for direct-current circuits,
and is made up to 20-horsepower in size, and for voltages, of
115, 230 and 550. The application of the motor to linotype equipments,
ventilating outfits, machine tools, etc., is also outlined.
The extensive tables of dimensions, capacities, etc., in the
bulletin, will be found very useful in preparing specifications.</p>

<h2>GAS ENGINEERING.</h2>

<p>In order to meet the constantly increasing demand for
training in gas engineering, four courses have been established
at Cornell University. First, a course of lectures on
the general theory of gas engines; second, a course of lectures
on gas engine design; third, a drafting room course
in gas engine design; and fourth, a lecture course which treats
of the engineering problems involved in the conversion of
various solid and liquid fuels into gas fuels, and in the transmission
of gas fuels. This course discusses the different gas
making processes and gives descriptions and studies of designs
of apparatus used. The object of these four courses is
to give to the student taking them the fundamental ideas of
modern gas engineering.</p>

<p>The gas engine laboratory, which was moved into one of
the small buildings in the court after the building had been
rendered fireproof by concrete walls and floor, has proved a
very satisfactory addition to the laboratory and will doubtless
produce much valuable scientific information. It is now
equipped with examples of every important type of gas engine
which has been produced since the time of Brayton. A
producer gas plant is being installed and will soon be in practical
operation. Through the kindness of John Wilkinson,
M. E., Cornell 1889, chief engineer of the Franklin Co., a four-cylinder
Franklin automobile engine has been presented.</p>

<h2>THE PASSING OF A PIONEER.</h2>

<p>In our advertising columns this week, announcement is
made of the retirement from active business of the California
Electrical Works of San Francisco and the continuance
of that business under the name of the Western Electric
Company, which has directed its operation since it assumed
control in 1901.</p>

<p>With this change there passes into history a name so
closely identified with the pioneer days that to write the
history of the California Electrical Works is to write the
history of the electrical business of the early days of California.</p>

<p>The year 1871 witnessed the incorporation of the Electrical
Construction and Maintenance Company, afterward
the California Electrical Works. The officers were George
S. Ladd, president, John G. Ayres, business manager, and
S. B. Field, electrician and secretary. Their location was
on the top floor of a small frame building at the corner of
Montgomery and Jackson Streets, San Francisco.</p>

<p>This company absorbed all the business formerly handled
by outside electrical enterprise and acquired by purchase
the interests of Lundberg &amp; Marwedell, who had
been carrying on a limited business in the manufacture of
telephone apparatus and supplies, including the manufacture
of all telegraph instruments used by the Western
Union Telegraph Company on the Pacific Coast.</p>

<p>Previous to the incorporation of the Electrical Construction
and Maintenance Company, electrical development
on the Pacific Coast had been entirely confined to
the operations of the California State Telegraph Company.</p>

<p>In the year 1863, three telegraph circuits entered the
city of San Francisco, these being composed of No. 9 iron
wire supported on redwood poles and insulated with hook
insulators; but two of these circuits could be worked at the
same time, the “cross fire” between conductors rendering
a separate pole line for each conductor a necessity. In
those days every trouble on the line was attributed to the
fogs which were then as now very dense at certain periods
of the year.</p>

<p>In the year 1865 the fire alarm telegraph was introduced
in San Francisco, and Mr. Field was one of the operators
of this system. The following year, 1866, the first
private telegraph line was constructed between the offices
of Kelly, Hewston &amp; Company and their refinery about a
mile away. This circuit was made of baling wire—about No.
14 plain iron—with a joint every 150 feet. The instruments,
battery and dial (“A. B. C.”) were from A. T. &amp; J. N.
Chester &amp; Company of New York. The success of this line
was so immediate that quite a demand sprang up for such
installations, numbers of which were constructed and installed
by the Electrical Construction and Maintenance
Company under the supervision of Mr. Field. It may be
of interest to know that these instruments cost $125 each
in greenbacks, which were then rated at about 50 to 80 cents
on the dollar, and were sold in San Francisco for $250 each
in gold.</p>

<p>Housetop line construction cost $125 per mile and pole
line construction about $250 per mile.</p>

<p>About 1874, the American District Telegraph System
was introduced in San Francisco, the promoters being the
various stockholders of the Electrical Construction and
Maintenance Company, although the business was carried
on under a separate incorporation.</p>

<p>On June 14, 1876, the company consolidated with Mr.
Paul Seiler and Dr. Hirsch and incorporated under the
name of the California Electrical Works, changing their
location to the third floor of a brick building on Sutter
Street.</p>

<p>In the year 1877 the telephone was introduced on the
Pacific Coast, the first exchange being opened in the District
Telegraph office on Sansome Street, San Francisco.
In the summer of 1878 the first long-distance telephone line
was constructed for the North Bloomfield Gravel Mining
Company and various other adjacent claims commenced at
French Corrall in Yuba County. It extended to nearly the
summit of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the total length
of the line being about sixty miles with twenty-four stations.
This line was installed by the California Electrical
Works, the principal work being done by Mr. John O’Neil.
In this connection it will no doubt be of interest to know
that he is still in the employ of the company and we are indebted
to him for much of the information contained in this article.</p>

<p>During these early years the California Electrical
Works wired most of the principal buildings and residences
in San Francisco, including the old Palace Hotel, the James
B. Haggin residence, the Goad residence, the Concordia
Club, General Colgan’s residence, the Mark Hopkins’ Institute,
the Leland Stanford residence, the Chas. Crocker residence
and many others. These names represent many of
the most prominent early pioneers in California. Most of
the wiring was for call bells and the wire used on the
first installations was insulated with cotton braid and afterwards
varnished, the work being done in the shop of the
California Electrical Works.</p>

<p>The first drop annunciator on the Pacific Coast was
installed by the California Electrical Works in the office
of the Grand Hotel which was directly across the street
from the old Palace Hotel. This annunciator remained in
service until the earthquake and fire of 1906.</p>

<p>In 1877 the company installed the first electric light
power station on the Coast. The old California Theater
and Auction House, once so famous, was nightly illuminated
with “Jarblokoff” candles. During the year 1878 the company
obtained from Mr. Thos. A. Edison the first generator
for incandescent lights seen in the West, this machine
being one of the historical bi-polars with a capacity of about
160 lights. It was installed in the H. S. Crocker building on Bush
Street, as an exhibit, and attracted a great deal of attention.
The sockets for the lamps were very cumbersome and
had no keys and there was only one switch on the line, this
being placed on the frame of the generator. Shortly afterwards,
this machine was installed as a permanent exhibit in
the old Mechanics’ Pavilion on Larkin Street, and as a
result the California Electrical Works installed quite a
number of them during the next two years.</p>

<p>In 1886 the business was moved to 35 Market Street,
where better accommodations and increased floor space
were obtained. In 1890 they again moved to 409 Market
Street, where, owing to the increased volume of the business,
they occupied three floors. On December 16, 1901,
the Western Electric Company acquired the controlling interest
in the company and located at 547 Mission Street,
where three floors and a basement were occupied for offices
and stock. They remained in these quarters until the completion
of their present building at 642 Folsom Street,
where they moved in January, 1906, three months before
the catastrophe which visited San Francisco.</p>

<p>Farewell to the California Electrical Works. Welcome
to the Western Electric Company.</p>

<h2>BROOKS-FOLLIS AT HOME.</h2>

<p>The accompanying illustrations show the new home of the
Brooks-Follis Electric Corporation, 44-46 Second Street, San
Francisco, Cal. Mr. Frank Fowden, President of the company,
has clearly demonstrated what can be accomplished through
perseverance, will and optimism in San Francisco’s future.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">EXTERIOR.</p>
</div>

<p>At the time of the fire in 1906, this firm was located on Mission
Street. The business was apparently demolished, but April
24th found the Brooks-Follis Electric Corporation bobbing
up serenely at 563 Thirteenth Street, Oakland, where shipments
were made as rapidly as material could be obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus13.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption">INTERIOR.</p>
</div>

<p>In July, 1906, a corrugated iron building at 212-214 First
Street, became the temporary San Francisco home of the
firm, where all orders were handled to the best possible
advantage under the conditions existing at that time. These
quarters were acceptable while San Francisco was being
settled and the business growing.</p>

<p>At the present central location all the electrical men from
the interior can take a Market Street car and drop in at 44-46
Second Street, take a seat in Mr. Fowden’s office, read the “Electrical
Journals,” use the telephone and make themselves quite at
home.</p>

<hr />

<h2>TURBINE ACTIVITIES IN THE FAR EAST.</h2>

<p>No less than ten machines, aggregating 25,000 horsepower,
are included in a large shipment of Westinghouse turbo-electric
power equipment from East Pittsburg to the Far East. Most
of these machines will go to Japan for the equipment of railway,
lighting, and manufacturing plants.</p>

<p>One of the first machines to be put in service will be a 1,500-kilowatt
turbine unit for Manila, to be installed in a station with
four other machines of like construction put into service several
years ago. Past experience with these machines has resulted
in the recent extension. It will be recalled that this railway
system was engineered and constructed by the American engineering
firm of J. G. White &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Hardly second in importance is the large turbine station
of the Osaka Electric Company, Osaka, Japan, now building.
This will be one of the largest power stations in Japanese territory,
and will contain, for the present, 15,000 kilowatts in five
units. Three of these machines are now being shipped from East
Pittsburg. The remainder will follow as fast as they can be
built and tested. The Osaka installation is under direct charge
of Messrs. Takata &amp; Co., of New York and Tokio.</p>

<p>In the strictly manufacturing field, there are two installations
in process of erection, for the Imperial Steel Works of the
Japanese government and the ship yards of the Hakkaido Tanko
Steamship Company. Two 500-kilowatt Westinghouse-Parsons
turbo units will comprise an initial installation in each of these
plants. This gratifying reception of American motive-power machinery
in the Far East, especially Japan, may be regarded as
an index of future operations where government inspection is
exceedingly rigid and is exercised along lines much more detailed
than in this country.</p>

<hr />

<p>The General Electric Company has obtained very satisfactory
results with the tungsten lamp. They have shipped over 75,000
to all parts of the country, and the breakage in shipment is
below one and one-half per cent. They state that they are issuing
a new bulletin covering tungsten lamps, both series and
multiple, and have a large production, good stocks, and are
in position to make prompt shipment, particularly of the 100-watt
and all types of tungsten lamps which they have standardized.</p>

<h2>TRADE NOTES</h2>

<p>The American Automatic Telephone Co., formerly of Rochester,
N. Y., and the Select Telephone Mfg. Co., formerly of
Springfield, Ohio, are now located in their new plant at Urbania,
Ohio, under the name of the American Automatic Telephone Co.</p>

<h2>NEWS NOTES</h2>

<h3>POWER AND LIGHT.</h3>

<p>Meadow Lake, Wash.—The Washington Water Power Company
will build a power-house.</p>

<p>Eugene, Ore.—It is reported that the Willamette Valley company
which supplies Eugene with electric light and power is
soon to install an entirely new equipment of engines and dynamos
in the generating plant at this place.</p>

<p>Republic, Wash.—The county commissioners granted to
Arthur Phillips and H. D. Merritt franchises, each for a period
of thirty-five years, to lay water mains from Deer Creek to the
town of Orient, water pipes throughout the town, and for a pole
line and wiring lighting the town and furnishing heat and power.</p>

<p>Twin Bridges, Mont.—Henry Pankey, superintendent of the
Easton and Pacific mines, above Virginia City, has returned from
California and will at once push matters connected with the
erection of an electric power plant at Blaine Springs, which is
intended to furnish electric power for the lighting of the county
seat.</p>

<p>New Westminster, B. C.—Managing Director Buntzen, of the
British Columbia Electric Railway, held a conference with the
city council recently to discuss the necessity of erecting a new
dam at Lake Coquitlam. Mr. Buntzen agreed that it was necessary,
the present one being but a temporary affair. He will
recommend the erection of a dam of the best construction to be
put up this year.</p>

<p>Cranbrook, B. C.—The mining and general industries of
southeast Kootenai will be vigorously stimulated by the fact that
Wisconsin capital has now been secured to put through and
fully equip the undertaking of the Bull River Power and Light
Company on Bull River, near Fort Steele. The enterprise involves
the production of over 10,000 horsepower of electrical
energy from the river.</p>

<p>Lewiston, Ida.—Development of power on the Clearwater
River at Lewiston is at last to become a reality. Work has
begun on a power plant within the city limits of Lewiston, which
will eventually develop more than 50,000 horsepower. The North
Coast Power Company, represented in this field by Engineer
Frank McKean and George W. Tannahill, is the concern undertaking
the work, and it is understood that the power so developed
is to be used for an extensive system of interurban lines connecting
Lewiston and vicinity with Clarkston, Asotin, Anatone,
Cloverland, and Pomeroy, and extending into the Craig Mountain
timber belt and to the cement, lime, and coal deposits on the
Snake River above Lewiston.</p>

<p>Tacoma, Wash.—With the granting of a franchise by the
county commissioners to Donald Fletcher, the electric power plant
to be established on the Teanaway River, at Cle Elum, in Kittitas
County, is expected to be a reality. The franchise calls for the
beginning of work within two years, a completion of one-fourth
of it in five years, and operation in ten years. By the franchise,
permission is granted to Mr. Fletcher to string his electric cable
along all of the roads in Pierce County. The line will also have
to pass through King and Kittitas Counties. Mr. Fletcher’s plan
is to build his power plant below the government dam on the
Teanaway River, where he believes that at least 110,000 horsepower
can be developed. The current brought from the river
will be used in supplying light and power in Buckley, Puyallup,
Sumner, and Tacoma, and other cities in Pierce and King Counties,
according to present plans.</p>

<h3>ELECTRIC RAILROADS.</h3>

<p>Columbus, Mont.—There will be an electric railroad built
between Columbus and Cooke City, a distance of sixty miles, and
work on the proposition will commence within the next two
months.</p>

<p>Helena, Mont.—It is possible that the Helena Light and Railway
Company will expend $70,000 in constructing a new car line
to the fair grounds this summer, and in purchasing cars and
equipment for handling the crowds which attend the annual State
fair.</p>

<p>Turner, Ore.—The Oregon Electric has just finished its
survey from Salem to this place, and Turner people confidently
expect an electric railroad in a short time. There is an impression
that the road will continue on south to Albany or that a
branch line will be built east into the Stayton neighborhood.</p>

<p>Okanogan, Wash.—The financial aid of English capitalists,
who will take over an issue of $3,000,000 in bonds at 85 cents
net, practically has assured the construction of the Okanogan
electric railway, a road 75 miles long, which will pass directly
through the Okanogan country, according to A. M. Dewey, who
has offices in the Empire State Building, Spokane.</p>

<p>Woodburn, Ore.—A standard-gauge electric railroad will be
built by the Valley Railway Company from West Woodburn to
Woodburn, three miles, and thence through Monitor to Scotts
Mills, and on up into the foothills to Wilhoit Springs, a health
resort in the Cascades. A branch will be extended from Monitor
to Silverton. Construction work will be commenced May 15.</p>

<p>Portland, Ore.—An electric railway company organized by
Portland and Seattle men will build a line from Condon to
Bend, crossing the John Day River and securing power from that
stream, also erecting a dam 200 feet high in the Deschutes
River and developing power there. Among those who are engineering
the deal are Dr. H. I. Keeney, George C. Mason, and
Mark W. Gill.</p>

<p>Pendleton, Ore.—An electric line from Pendleton to Irrigon,
touching at Echo, Fosters, Hermiston, and Umatilla, and tapping
all that vast section of country now being reclaimed by the government
and other private irrigation concerns, is one of the plans
of Dr. H. W. Coe, of Portland, who is promoting lands under
the Furnish project. A preliminary survey has already been made.
The proposed road will be a little more than 50 miles long. It will
also eventually be connected with the Milton-Walla Walla electric
line.</p>

<h3>INCORPORATION.</h3>

<p>Santa Barbara.—The Monterey Oil and Development Company
has been incorporated with a capital stock of $100,000 by
Santa Maria people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<h3>TRANSPORTATION.</h3>

<p>Douglas, Ariz.—Douglas and Bisbee are to be connected by
an interurban traction line, which is being projected by Cochise
County capitalists under the name of the Cochise County Electric
Railroad Company. The men interested in the project are James
S. Douglas, W. H. Brophy, and George H. Neale. The capital
stock is $500,000.</p>

<p>Walla Walla, Wash.—The County Commissioners have
granted a franchise to the Mt. Hood Electric Railway Company
to construct and operate an electric railway along the edge of
the cemetery. The only condition attached is that the company
start construction by the first of the year and have the road
completed by January 1, 1910.</p>

<p>Los Angeles.—The City Council has passed ordinance 16,320,
granting the Los Angeles Railway Company the right to construct
and, for a period of 21 years, to operate and maintain a
double-track electric street railroad, commencing at the intersection
of San Pedro and Thirtieth Streets, thence southerly along
San Pedro Street to its intersection with South Park Avenue.</p>

<p>Pasadena.—The City Council has agreed to turn down the
request of the Pacific Electric Company for a franchise from
Lake Avenue to east city limits on California Street and to turn
down the proposition of the company to vacate rights to build
on several streets in Pasadena, but voted to grant a franchise
on East California Street for a short strip of railway between
Mentor Avenue and Tournament Park, where the company has
no franchise.</p>

<p>Klamath Falls, Ore.—The Klamath Falls Electric Railway
Company is making arrangements for the extension of its street
car line this summer. C. N. Hawkins and W. K. Brown, directors
of the company, will superintend the work. E. R. Reames,
local manager, states that the Belt Line will likely be completed,
as negotiations are now under way for enough steel for the
entire circuit. The old horse car will be replaced by some kind
of motor.</p>

<p>Portland, Ore.—The announcement has been made simultaneously
with the increase of the capital stock of the Oregon
Electric Company from $2,000,000 to $10,000,000 that the company
would begin actual construction on the first of 283 miles
of extension branches and laterals to the Portland-Salem electric
line, which was placed in operation within the last few weeks.
The roads mapped out are from Portland to Tillamook via
Hillsboro; Portland to Eugene via Corvallis; Salem to Mill City,
Salem to Dallas, Salem to Albany, and Albany to Cascadia.</p>

<p>Woodland.—T. C. Gregory, president of the Vallejo &amp; Northern
Railroad, states that he has taken up the condemnation proceedings
against the Reed Orchard Company for the large tract
of land which the company wishes to acquire opposite Sacramento.
The promoters of the road say that they now have all
the strategic positions, and a request has been filed with the
attorney-general for permission to bring suit in the name of the
State against the city of Sacramento, in order to obtain the
freight franchise in that city, regarding which some trouble has
been experienced.</p>

<p>Portland, Ore.—An electric railway company has been organized
by Portland and Seattle capitalists, among them being
Dr. H. I. Keeny, Geo. C. Mason, and Mark W. Gill, with Eastern
capital also behind them, for the purpose of building an
electric railway from Condon to Bend, crossing the John Day
River. A dam 200 feet high will be erected in the Deschutes
River and power developed there. It is proposed to tap the coal
field near Madras and serve the Oregon King gold mine, controlled
by Jack Edwards, near Ashwood. The concern will be
known as the Portland Construction Company.</p>

<h3>TRANSMISSION.</h3>

<p>Oroville.—The new Humbug Valley power plant is but one
of a number of plants that the Oro Water, Light and Power
Company is preparing to construct.</p>

<p>Placerville.—James O’Brien and Robert Duncan have filed
notice of the location and appropriation of 5,000 inches of water
of the main fork of the Cosumnes River, for power, mining, and
irrigation.</p>

<p>Lewiston, Idaho.—Commissioners Salsberg and Miller have
reported favorably on the application of the North Coast Power
Company for a tract of ground near the water plant for a period
of three years, to be used as a site for a power plant.</p>

<p>Chihuahua, Mex.—The Aguila Amalgamated Mining Company,
which has taken over eight properties in the Hostotipaquilla
district in Jalisco, is planning to erect an electric power plant
on Santiago River. J. Burpee Melly, of Boston, Mass., is president
of the company.</p>

<p>Placerville.—R. H. Sterling, manager of the American River
Electric Company, is at the company’s power-house near this
place to inspect the recent work of repairs which has been going
on at the power-house for the past two months. Four Pelton
water wheels have been installed at a cost, including setting, of
$10,000. The new wheels have a capacity of 6,000 horsepower
and take the place of those placed five years ago. The large
switchboard has also been received and other improvements
made. Assistant Superintendent H. McGuirk and twenty-five
men have been employed on the job.</p>

<p>San Francisco.—Agents of E. H. Harriman have secured
valuable water rights in the Sierra Nevada and Siskiyou Mountains
of California at four strategic points. Harriman is planning
for the future, by means of these water rights, to generate
electric power for the movement of Southern Pacific trains on
various sections of its lines. The rights are located in the mountains
of Kern County, east of Bakersfield; in Fresno County,
east of Fresno; in El Dorado County, on the Rubicon River, and
on the Klamath River, in Siskiyou County. It is stated that
fully $15,000,000 ultimately will be spent in developing power at

to lay gas pipes and mains.</p>

<p>Portland, Ore.—The County Commissioners have granted a
franchise to C. L. Pritchard for an electric light system complete
for the town of Washougal.</p>

<p>East Newport.—Test work has commenced on the natural
gas locations in the big asphaltum beds just across the bay from
this point, which were filed on recently by W. W. Wilson, P. T.
Evans, and Archie Sharpe, of Riverside, and Lew W. Wallace,
of Newport. If the supply of natural gas is found to be sufficiently
large to warrant it, a plant will be established and pipe
lines will be run to Newport and East Newport for lighting and
cooking purposes.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
